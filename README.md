JS-Snake
========

This is the clasic Snake game made with JavaScript

It is my first attempt to make a game with Java Script and HTML, so don't judge me hard

This is the game engine and verry basic user interface. I plan to create more advanced UI, but for now I will concentrate on game engine.

The game is not finished, yet I have to implement Hiscore Table and proper end of the game.

GAMEPLAY
=======

You are the green snake and have to eat red apples and avoid grey stones and field edges. You have five lives and when you eat, you grow. If you bite yourself - you die.


CONTROLS
========

Use arrow keys to control the snake.
Press "p" for pause and "q" to quit.
