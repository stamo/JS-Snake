JS-Snake
========

This is the clasic Snake game made with JavaScript

It is my first attempt to make a game with Java Script and HTML, so don't judge me hard

This is the game engine and verry basic user interface. 

GAMEPLAY
=======

You are the green android snake and have to eat "bitten apples" and avoid stones and field edges. You have five lives and when you eat, you grow. If you bite yourself - you die.


CONTROLS
========

Use arrow keys to control the snake.
Press "p" for pause and "q" to quit.

On mobile devices you can control the snake by tilting the device, but it is not verry precise. May be I'll implement touch interface.
